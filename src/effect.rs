//! `Cmd` — discrete app-level state changes produced by command evaluation.
//!
//! The input pipeline is:
//!
//! 1. `tokenize` / `classify` — `KeyEvent` → `Expr` (pure parsing).
//! 2. `handle_expr` — `Expr` → buffer mutations + `Vec<Cmd>` for everything
//!    beyond the buffer (mode, status, LSP, IO, prompt, ...).
//! 3. `App::run_cmds` — apply the cmds to the rest of the app state.
//!
//! Pure buffer ops are *not* listed here — they're applied directly inside
//! `handle_expr` against `&mut Buffer`, which already exposes a clean
//! mutation surface. Wrapping every cursor move and yank in a Cmd variant
//! would balloon the enum without buying anything; the split is drawn at
//! the buffer boundary instead.
